Avocado smoothie
==

Ingredients for one smoothie
--

- one ripe avocado (i.e. not super hard so as to get a smooth texture)
- 1/4 cup (60 mL) sweetened condensed milk
- 4 ice cubes
- 1/2 cup (120 mL) water

The actual proportions work well for me with a Hass avocado, the kind
and size most commonly found in California grocery stores. The ice
cubes are assumed to come from a standard ice cube tray.

Instructions
--

You need a personal-size blender or larger.
Put all the ingredients into the blender. Blend. Pour. Drink with a
wide straw.
