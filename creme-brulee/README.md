Crème brûlée
==

This recipe is easy and fast if you have the right tools:

* Ramekins or small bowls and a way to create a bain-marie in the
  oven. Traditional, shallow (2 cm) ramekins are harder to work with: they
  make water spillage more likely and they take more room in the
  oven. They also result in a high caramel-to-cream ratio, which I
  find excessive. For those reasons, I prefer ramekins that are at
  least 4 cm deep.
* A butane torch, which you can order online. Butane canisters are the
  same as those used for refillable lighters and they can be purchased
  in stores where cigarettes are sold.

Ingredients:
--

* 3 egg yolks
* 1/3 cup sugar (70 g) and some more for the caramel crust.
* 1/2 quart heavy whipping cream (250 mL)
* 1/2 tbsp vanilla extract

Process
--

Pre-heat oven to 300°F (150°C). A higher temperature up to 350°F
(180°C) will reduce the baking time; just make just your crèmes
brûlées don't turn brown. Their color shouldn't change during baking.

Bring heavy whipping cream to a boil then let it cool
down for about 5 minutes. Add vanilla. Meanwhile, mix egg yolks and
sugar. Pour slowly the warm cream into the mixture of egg yolk and
sugar while stirring. Resulting mixture should be smooth.

Place empty ramekins into *bain-marie* consisting of a larger bowl or
tray filled with hot water. Pour mixture into ramekins
carefully so as to avoid getting water into the ramekins. Put the
whole thing into the oven. Let it bake for about *one hour*, until it
looks no longer liquid.

Extract the ramekins from the oven. Refrigerate for two hours or
more. Right before serving, cover each ramekin with granulated sugar. Use
*butane torch* to caramelize the sugar quick enough so that the crèmes
brûlées remain cool. For best results, wait 5-10 minutes until the
powdered sugar is moist before starting the burning process, otherwise
the melted sugar concentrates into droplets.
